# 🛒 Electronics Store

This project is a Single Page Application (SPA) for an online electronics store built with Angular 19. The application allows users to browse products, filter them by categories and price, add items to a shopping cart, and view selected items.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Product Filtering:** Search and filter products by name, category, and price.
- 🛒 **Shopping Cart:** Add products to the cart with persistent state across sessions.
- 📄 **Pagination:** Navigate through a large number of products using pagination.
- ⚡ **State Management:** Reactive state management using NGRX.
- 🎨 **UI Components:** Built with Angular Material for a modern user interface.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Angular 21** (using the new syntax `@if`, `@for`, `track`)
- **NGRX** for state management
- **Angular Material** for UI components
- **json-server** for mock backend
- **TypeScript** for strong typing
